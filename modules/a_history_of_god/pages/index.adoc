= A History of God

== In The Beginning ...

Some people suggest that there has been a primitive monotheism before men and women had started to worship a number of Gods (paganism). Some kind of Supreme Deity, could have been known as Sky God or High God.

Later High God gets replaced by more attractive gods of pagan pantheon.

As consequence of our scientific culture, we have edited out the sense of the 'spiritual' or the 'holy' which pervades the lives of people in more traditional societies at every level and which was once an essential component of our human experience of the world.

In the South Sea Islands (Polynesia or the Polynesian Triangle, an area bounded by the Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand and Easter Island); they call this mysterious force _mana_; other experience it as presence or spirit; sometimes it is felt as an impersonal power, like a form of radioactivity or electricity. It was believed to reside in tribal chief, in plants, rocks or animals.

The Latins experienced _numina_ (spirits) in sacred groves (a small wood or other group of trees). Arabs felt that landscape was populated by _jinn_.

[NOTE]
====
*numen* +
_noun_
plural noun: numina +
the spirit or divine power presiding over a thing or place. +
"the spirit of the place—its numen—was strong" +
The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as flamen is "that which is produced by blowing", i.e., a gust of wind.
It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself. +

Numinous (/ˈnjuːmɪnəs/) is a concept derived from the Latin _numen_ meaning "arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring". The term was popularized by the German theologian Rudolf Otto in his influential 1917 German book _Das Heilige_, which appeared in English as _The Idea of the Holy_ in 1923. He also used the phrase *_mysterium tremendum_* as an alternative description. Otto's concept of the numinous influenced thinkers including Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and C. S. Lewis.

In Paleolithic period when agriculture was developing, the cult of Mother Goddess expressed a sense that fertility which was transforming human life was actuaually sacred. Liek the old Sky God, she was absorbed into later pantheos and took her place alongside older deities. She was usually one of the most powerful gods, certainly more powerful than the Sky God, who remained a rather shadowy figure. She is depicted as naked pregnant woman sometimes. She was called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna[_Inanna_] in ancient Sumeria (South Mesopotamia), _Ishtar_ in Babylon (Middle Mesopotamia), _Anat_ in Canaan (Israel/Palestine), _Isis_ in Egypt and _Aphrodite_ in Greece, and remarkably similar stories were devised in all these cultures to express her role in spiritual lives of the people.

*4000 BCE*
Sumerian lived in Tigris-Euphrates valley (Mesopotamia). The cities were Ur, Erech and Kish. Sumerians devises cueiform script, built extraordinary temple-towers called ziggurats and evolved an impressive law, literature and mythology.

Sumerians were invaded by the Semitic Akkadians, who adopted Sumerian culture. The Akkadian Empire was the first ancient empire of Mesopotamia, centered in the city of Akkad and its surrounding region. The empire united Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under one rule. Akkadian, an East Semitic language, gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC

*2000 BCE*
Amorites had conquered this Sumerian Akkadian civilization and made Babylon their capital. The term Amorites is used in the Bible to refer to certain highland mountaineers who inhabited the land of Canaan, described in Genesis as descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham (Gen. 10:16)

*1500 BCE*
Assyrians had settled in nearby Ashur, and eventually conquered Babylon during 800 BCE. The Babylonian tradition also affected the mythology and religon of Canaan (the Promised Land of the ancient Israelites). The Babylon itself awas supposed to be an image of heaven with each one of its temples a replica of a celestial palace. In Babylon, this link with the divine world was celebreated and perpetuated annually in the great New Year Festival of 11 days, by 17th century BCE in the month of Nisan (April). 

*Enuma Elish*
On afternoon of the 4th day of the festival, priests recite the _Enuma Elish_, the epic poem which celebrated the victory of gods over chaos. In the beginning said the _Enuma Elish_, the gods emerged two by two from a formless, watery waste - a substance which was itself divine. In Babylonian myth, there was no creation out of nothing, an idea that was alien to the ancient world.

Ea was able to overpower Apsu and Mummu and he could not overpower Tiamat. Tiamat produced whole brood misshapen monsters to fight on her behalf.

Ea's son Marduk promised at a assembly of gods to fight Tiamat on condition that he became their ruler. Marduk defeated Tiamat eventually. In this myth creativity is a struggle, achieved labiriously against overwhelming odds.

From Tiamat's vast corpse, Marduk decided to create a new world. He split her body in two from the arch of the sky and the world of men. The he devised laws that would keep everything in its appointed place. 

Finally, Marduk created humanity. He seized Kingu; a clumsy and unintelligent companion of Tiamat created by Tiamat after the defeat of Apsu, He slew Kingu and shaped the first man by mixing divine blood with the dust.

The pagan vision was holisitc. The gods were not shut off from the human race oin a separate, ontological  sphere: divinity was not essentially different from humanity. The gods and humans shared the same predicament, the only difference being that the gods were more powerful and were immortal.

The myth of Marduk and Tiamat may have influenced the people of Canaan, who told a very similar story about Baal-Habad, the god of storm and fertility.
Baal fought with Yam-Nahar, the god of the seas and rivers. Baal and Yam, both lived with El, the Canaanite High God. Baal defeated Yam and let go on request of Asherah as she said it is not honourable act to kill a prisoner.

@endmindmap
....

Baal dies and descend to the world of Mot, the god of death and sterility. El himself couldn't redeem his son. Anat mercilessly kill Mot. Later, Baal is brought back to life and restored to Anat, not known how. This climax of wholeness and harmony, symbolized by union of sexes was celebrated by means of ritual sex in ancient Canaan.

The death of a god, the quest of the goddess and the triumphant return to the divine sphere were constant religions themes in many cultures and would recur in the very different religion of the One God worshipped by Jews, Christians and Muslims.

This religion is attributed in Bible to Abraham, who left Ur and eventually settled in Canaan sometime between 2000 -1900 BCE. Some scholars think he may have been one of the wandering chieftains who had led their people from Mesopotamia towards Mediterranean at the end of the third millenium BCE. These wanderers spoke west semitic languages, of which Hebrew is one.

The two earliest biblical authors, whose work is found in Genedis and Exodus, were probably writing during eighth century. One is known as 'J' because he calls his God 'Yahweh' and the other 'E' since he prefers to use the more formal divine title 'Elohim'. By 8th century BCE, the Israelites had divided Canaan into two kingdoms and were beginning to develop a distinct version of their own. J is writing in southern Kingdon of Judah starts his history with an account of the creation of world which, compared with the _Enuma Elish_, is lacking in interest or enthusiasm. E, from northern Kingdon of Israel, perfers to use the more formal divine title 'Elohim'.


It is highly likely that Abraham, his son Isaac and grandson Jacob would have certainly believed in the existence of such dieties as Marduk, Baal and Anat. 

*Abraham (born Abram ben Terah c. 2150 BCE Ur Kaśdim, Kaldea, Sumer (present-day Southern Iraq))* El, the High God of Canaan, the deity introduces himself as El Shaddai (El of the mountain). Elsewhere he is called El Elyon (The Most High God) or El of Bethel. The name of the Canaanite High God is preserved in such Hebrew names as Isra-El or Ishma-El. El seems to be a friendly god who appears to Abraham in dreams or in epiphanies, and sometimes assumes human form. J always identifies Yahweh as the only god. Yahweh appeared to Moses in awe insipiring volcanic eruption and the Israelities had to keep their distance. In a chapter of J's book; Abraham is commanded by Yahweh to leave his family in  Haran, in eastern Turkey and migrate to Canaan near the Mediterranean Sea. We have been told that his father Terah, a pagan, had already migrated westward with his family from Ur. Yahweh tell Abraham that he has special destiny: he will become the father of a mighty nation and one day his descendants will possess the land of Canaan.

*Isaac In 2050 BCE* When Abraham and Sarah who was barren and had passed the menopause heard this promise from El and when against all odds, their son is finally born, they call him Isaac, a name that may mean 'laughter'. The joke turns sour, as God demands to Abraham that he must sacrifice his only some to him. When Abraham tskes Isaac on a 3 day journey to the Mount of Moriah, later the site of the Temple in Jerusalem. Isaac carried the wood for his own holocaust. In last moement, God releneted and said it was all a test and Abraham is worthy of becomeing the father of a mighty nation.

*Jacob (son of Isaac)* While going to Haran, Turkey to find a wife, he slept at Luz in Jordan valley, saw El in his dreams who blessed him and repeated the promises that he had made to Abraham: Jacob's descendants would becaome a mighty nation and possess the land of Canaan. When he wakes, J makes him say; truly Yahweh is in this place, and I never knew it. This is nothing less than house of God _(bethEl)_; this is the gate of heaven. This saying is instictively pagan. Babylon itself, the abode of gods was called 'Gate of the gods' _(Bab-ili)_. Befoere he left Beth-El, Jacob had decided to make the god he had encountered there his _elohim_: this was a technical term, signifying everything that the gods could mean for men and women. He struck a bargain: in return for El's (or Yahweh's as J calls him) special protection to look after in Haran, Jacob would make him his _elohim_.  

*_People would continue to adopt a particular conception of the divine because it worked for them, not because it was scientifically or philosophically sound._*

Following a severe drought in his homeland of Canaan, Jacob and his descendants, with the help of his son Joseph (who had become a confidante of the pharaoh), moved to Egypt where Jacob died at the age of 147.

While returning from Haran with his wives, Jacob met a stranger with whom he wrestled all night ansd later became aware that his opponent had been none other than El himself. Jacob named this place Peni-El [El's face] which was at the ford of Jabbok on the West Bank.

*Moses in 13th century BCE* The events of Exodus (of Israelites from Egypt's Pharaoh rule) made Yahweh the definitive God of Israel and that Moses was able to convince the Israelities that he really was the one and the same as El, the God beloved by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

*Joshua in 13th century BCE* In the story of Mount Sinai, where God (Yahweh) is purported to have appeared to Moses and given him the Ten Commandments. A ceremony was conducted by Moses's successor Joshua who represented Yahweh. Joshua said:

[quote]
____
So now, fear Yahweh and serve him perfectly and sincerely; put away the gods that once you served beyond the River [Jordan] and in Egypt and serve Yahweh, choose today whom you wish to serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are now living.
____


*Eli-Jah in 9th century BCE* After Joshua, many people continued to follow pagan culture and rituals they had been in ancient times. King Solomon (970 to 931 BCE, son of King David) was himself great syncretist. He had many pagan wives who worshipped their own gods. 

[NOTE]
====
Syncretism /ˈsɪŋkrətɪzəm/ is the combining of different beliefs, while blending practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as eclecticism) as well as politics (syncretic politics).
====

In 869 King Ahab's wife Jezbel, daughter of King Tyre and Sidon in what what is now Lebanon, was an ardent pagan. She was intent upon converting the country to the religion of Baal and Asherah. Ahab remained true to Yehwah but did not try to curb Jezbel's proselytism.  

[NOTE]
====
Proselytism (/ˈprɒsəlɪtɪzəm/) is the act or fact of religious conversion, and it also includes actions which invite such conversion.
The English-language word proselytize derives from the Greek language prefix (pros-, "toward") and the verb(érchomai, "I come") in the form of (prosélytos, "newcomer")
====

When a severe drought struck in the ends of King Ahab's (seventh king of Israel) reign, a prophet named Eli-Jah summoned King Ahab and people to a contest on Mount Carmel between Yahweh and Baal. Baal priests couldn't perform the miracle and he could and was declared as winner. He got Baal priests slaughtered. Upon Elijah's prayer Yahweh God made it rain and proved himself to be just as effective in fertility as he was in war(Exodus). 

*The period 800-200 BCE has been termed as Axial Age.* In all main regions of the civilized world, people created new ideologies that have continued to be crucial and formative. The new religious system reflected the changed economic and social conditions. Power was shifted from king and priest, temple and palace, to the market class with the rise of a merchant class. Inequality and exploitation became more apparent and people bagan to realize that their own behavior could affect the fate of future generations. Each region developed a distinctive ideology to address these problems and concerns: Taoism and Confucianism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India and philosophical rationalism in Europe. The Middle East did not produce a uniform solution but in Iran and Israel, Zoroaster and Hebrew prophets evolved different versions of monotheism.

According to the Hebrew Bible, the Kingdom of Israel, was one of two successor states to the former United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Historians often refer to the Kingdom of Israel as the *"Northern Kingdom"* or as the *"Kingdom of Samaria"* to differentiate it from the Southern *Kingdom of Judah*.

*In 742 BCE*, A member of the Judaean royal family *Isaiah* had a vision in the Temple which King Solomon had built in Jerusalem. It was anxious time for people of Israel. King Uzziah of Judah had died that year and was succeeded by King Ahaz, who was a syncretist and would encourage his subjects to worship pagan gods alongside Yahweh. The Northern kingdom of Israel was in a state of near anarchy: after the death of King Jeroboam II, five kings had sat on the throne between 746 to 736, while King Tigleth Pilesar III, King of Assyria, looked hungrily at their land. 

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Map_of_Assyria.png[title="Map of Assyria"]

*Isaiah In 742 BCE*  was probably full of foreboding after King Uzziah's death, at the same time he may have been uncomfortably aware of the inappropriateness of the lavish Temple ceremonials. Despite being from ruler class, Isaiah had populist and democratic views and was highly sensitive to the plight of the poor. He may have feared that religion of Israel had lost its integrity and inner meaning.
In his vision, Isaiah saw Yahweh himself sitting on his throne in heaven directly abobe the Temple, which was replica of his celestial court on earth. He was attended by two seraphs, who were cried out to one another antiphonally: Holy! holy! holy is Yahweh Sabaoth. His glory fill the whole earth.

[.lead]
When we use word 'holy' today, we ususally refer to the state of moral execellence. The Hebrew _kaddosh_, however, means otherness, a radical separation.

The new Yahweh of the Axial age was still 'the god of the armies' but was no longer mere god of war. Nor was he simply a tribal deity, who was passionately biased in favour of Israel: his glory was no longer confined to the Promised Land but filled the whole earth.

*Isaiah In 742 BCE* was filled with mortal terror and cried aloud:

[quote, Isaiah 6:5]
____
What a wretched state I am in! I am lost for I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have looked at the King, Yahweh Sabaoth.
____

One of the seraphs flew towards him with a live coal and purified his lips, so thay could utter the word of God.

_Many of the prophets were either unwilling to speak on God's behalf or unable to do so._

[example]
When God had called Moses, prototype of all prophets, from the burning bush and commanded him to be his messenger to Pharaoh and the children of Israel, Moses had protested that he was 'not able to speak well'. God had made him allowances for his impediment and permitted his brother Aaron to speak in Moses's stead.

Yahweh asked to Isaiah: 'Whom shall I send?Who will be our messenger?' and, like Moses beefore him, Isaiah immediately replied: 'Here I am! (_hineni_) send me!'

_The point of this vision was not to enlighten the prophet but to give him a practical job to do. Primarily the prophey is one who stands in God's presence but this experience of transcendence results not in the imparting of knowledge - as in Buddhism - but in action. The prophet will not be characterised by mystical illumination but by obedience._

*Isaiah In 742 BCE* would live to see the destruction of the northern kingdom (Kingdom of Israel) in 722 and the *deportation of the ten tribes by Assyrian King*. Following the destruction of Israel (the northern kingdom) by Assyria in 721 BCE, refugees came south to Judah, bringing with them traditions, notably the concept of Yahweh as the only God who should be served, which had not previously been known. In 701 Sennacherib (king of Neo-Assyrian empire) would invade Kingdon of Judah with a vast Assyrian army. *Isaiah* had the thankless task of warning his people of these impending catastrophies.

The old partisan God of Moses would have cast Assyria into the role of the enemy; the God of Isaiah saw Assyria as his intrument. It was not Sargon II or his son Sennacherib who would drive the Israelites into exile and devastate the country. It is 'Yahweh who drives the people out'.

The pagan gods depended upon the ceremonies which involved sacrifices to renew their depleted energies; their prestige dependend in part of the magnificence of their temples. Now Yahweh was actually saying that these things were utterly meaningless. Like other sages and philosophers in the Oikumene (the inhabited, or the habutable world), Isaiah felt that exterior observance was not enough. Isaraelites must discover the inner meaning of their religion. Yahweh wanted compassion rather than sacrifice. 

[quote, Isaiah 1:15]
____
You may multiply your prayers, +
I shall not listen. +
Your hands are covered with blood, +
wash, make yourselves clean. +
Take your wrong-doing out of my sight. +
Cease to do evil. +
Learn to do good, +
search for justice, +
help the opressed, +
be just to the orphan, +
plead for the widow. +
____

*The prophets had discovered for themselves the overriding duty for compassion, which would become hallmark of all the religions formed in the Axial Age (800 BCE - 200 BCE).*

The social ideal of the prophets had been implicit in the cult of Yahweh since Sinai: the story of the Exodus had stressed that God was on the side of the weak and opressed, The difference was that now Israelites themselves were castigated as oppressors. 

During the same time of *Isaiah*, there were two more preachers already preaching a similar message in the northern kingdon (Kingdom of Israel).

The first was *Amos in 760–755 BCE* who was no aristocrat like *Isaiah* but a shepherd who had originally lived in Tekoain the southern kingdom. He had gone to the northern kingdom on God Yahweh's command. When he was rebuked by the Amaziah, the priest of Beth-El, he tells it is God's command:

[quote, Amos 3:8]
____
The lion roars, who can help feeling afraid? +
The Lord Yahweh speaks: who can refuse to prophesy? +
____

*Amos during 760–755 BCE* was first of the prophets to emphasize the importance of social justice and compassion.

Most Israelites declined the prophet's invitation to enter into a dialogue with Yahweh. They preferred a less demanding religion of cultic observance either in the Jerusalem Temple or in the old fertility cults of Canaan. _This continues to be the case: the religion of compassion is only followed by a minority; most religous people are content with decorous worship in synagogue, church, temple and mosque._ So two hundred years later, around 10th century Israelites were still taking part in fertility rites and sacred sex, as we see in the oracles of the prophet *Hosea*, Amos's contemporary. 

Where *Amos around 760–755 BCE* attacked social wickedness, *Hosea* dwelt on the lack inwardness in Israelite religion: the knowledge of God was related to the love ('_hesed_'), implying an interior appropriation and attachment to Yahweh that must supersede exterior observance.

*Hosea in 8th-century BCE*, whose wife Gomer was once lost to him to other man gives us a startling insight into the way the prophets were developing their image of god. 

When they attributed their own human feelings and experiences to Yahweh, the prophets were in an important sense creating a god in their own image. Isaiah, a member of royal family, had seen Yahweh as a king. Amos had ascribed his own empathy with the suffering poor to Yahweh; Hosea saw Yahweh as a jilted husband, who still continued to feel a yearning tenderness for his wife. 

[quote, Hosea 2:16]
____
When that days comes - it is Yahweh who speaks +
she will call me, 'My husband,' +
no longer will she call me, 'My Baal.' +
I will take the names of the Baals off her lips, +
their names shall never be uttered again. +
____

_All religion must begin with some anthropomorphism. A deity which is  utterly remote from humanity, such as Aristotle's Unmoved Mover, cannot inspire a spiritual quest._

Like other prophets *Hosea in 8th-century BCE* was haunted by the horror of idolatry.

[quote, Hosea 13:2]
____
And now they add sin to sin, +
they smelt images from their silver, + 
idols of their own manufacture, +
smith's work, all of it. +
'Sacrifice to them,' they say.
Men blow kisses to calves!
____

This may seem unfair as people of Canaan and Babylon had never believed that their effigies of the gods were themselves divine. The effigy had been a symbol of divinity devised to direct the attention of the worshipper beyond itself. Yet the prohets frequently jeered at the deities of their pagan neighbours with a most unattractive contempt. These idols comapred to with Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, are _elilim_, Nothings. The _goyim_ (a non-Jewish person) who worship them are fools (or whores as per *Hosea*) and Yahweh hates them.


In the Axial age, when new ideologies were replacing the old veneration of gods, there was no vitriolic rejection of ancient deities. We have seen in Hinduism and Buddhism, people were encouraged to go beyond the gods rather than to turn upon them with loathing. Yet the prophet of Israel were unable to take this calmer view of the deities they saw as Yahweh's rivals. 

Most Israelites believed implicitly in the existence of the pagan deities. It is true that Yahweh was gradually taking over some of the functions of the _elohim_ of the Canaanites in certain circles: *Hosea* for example, was trying to argue that Yahweh was better fertility god than Baal. Bit it was obviously difficult to usurp the function of a goddess like Asherah, Ishtar, or Anat who still had a great following among women. Even though monotheists would insist that  their God transcended gender, he would remain essentially male. In part this was due to his origins as a tribal god of war. Yet his battle with the goddesses reflects a less positive characteristic of the Axial Age, which generally saw a decline in the status if womenand the female. It seems that in more primitive societies, women are sometimes help in higher esteem than men. 

.Trivia about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River#Origin_of_the_name[Amazon river]
[example]
The name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons[Amazon warriors], a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians mentioned in Greek mythology.

The rise of cities, however, meant that the more masculine qualities of martial, physical strength were exalted over female characteristics. Henceforth women were marginalised and became second class citizens in the new civilizations of the Oikumene.

Yahweh's victory was hard won. The Israelites were reluctant to this new concept of One God as compared to the South Asian people to the concept of Buddhism. In Psalm 82, we seem him making a play for leadership of the divine assembly which had played such an important role in both Babylonian and Canaanite myth.

*Judah in 640 BCE was a vassal of Assyria*, but Assyria now began a rapid and unexpected decline in power, leading to a resurgence of nationalism in Jerusalem. 

*In about 622 BCE, King Josiah of Judah* was anxious to reverse the syncretist policies of his predecessors, *King Manasseh (687-42 BCE)* and *King Amon (642-40 BCE)*. To promote the cult of Yahweh, Joisah had been making erepairs to the Temple in Jerusalem. During the repairs, the High Priest Hilkiah is said to have discovered an ancient manuscript which purported to be an account of Moses's last sermon to the children of Israel. There have been various theories about this 'discovery' by 'reforming party'. SOme suggest that it had been secretly written by Hilkiah and Shapan (Josiah's secretary) with the assistance of the prophetess Huldah, whom Josiah immediately consulted.  In his last sermon, Moses is made to give a new centrality to the covenant and the idea of the special election of Israel by Yahweh. In return, he demanded complete loyalty and fierce rejection of all other gods.

[TIP]
Today Jews give it a monotheistic interpretation, 'Yahweh _ehad_' is interpreted as Yahweh our God is one and unique. The Deuteronomist had not yet reached this modern perspective which Jew has given to the _Shema_.

*In about 622 BCE, King Josiah of Judah* instantly began a reform, acting with exemplary zeal. All the images, idols, and fertility symbols were taken out of the Temple and burned. Henceforth the priests were only allowed to sacrifice to Yahweh in the 'purified' Jerusalem Temple. Josiah, based on an early form of Deuteronomy 5–26, framed as a covenant (treaty) between Judah and Yahweh in which Yahweh replaced the Assyrian king.

*In 606 BCE, the Babylonian King Nebupolassar* would crush the Assyrians and begin to build his own empire.

The reformers rewrote Israelite history. The historical books of Jushua, Judges, Samuel and Kings ere revised according to the new ideology and, later the editors of the Pentateuch qadded passages that gave Deuteronomist interpretation of the Exodus myth to the older narratives of J and E. Yahweh was now the author of a holy war of extermination of native Canaanites in Canaan. 

[NOTE]
Pentateuch means the first five books of the Bible. These books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy

*In 604 BCE, the year of Babylon's King Nebuchadnezzar's accesion, the prohet Jeremiah (650 – c. 570 BC), also called the "weeping prophet"* revived the iconocalstic perspective of *Isaiah* which turned the turned the triumphalist doctrine of the Chosen People on it head: God was using Babylon as his instrument to punish Israel. They would go into exile for seventy years.
By the end of the 7th century BCE Assyria had been replaced by a new imperial power, Babylon. The trauma of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BCE by King Nebuchadnezzar, and the exile which followed, led to much theological reflection on the meaning of the tragedy, and the Deuteronomistic history was written as an explanation: Israel had been unfaithful to Yahweh, and the exile was God's punishment.

As long as the enemy stood at the gate, Jeremiah raged at his people in God's name(though before God, he pleaded on their behalf). Once Jerusalem had been conquered by babylonians in 587 BCE, the oracles from Yahweh became more comforting: he promised to save his people, now that they had learned their lesson, and bring them home.

Those who had gone into exile were forced to assimilate, as the northern tribes had been in 722 BCE by Assyrian King. They lived in two communities: one in babylon itself and the other on the banks of canal leading from the Euphrates called the Chebar, not far from Nippur and Ur, in Tel Aviv.

*Among the first batch of exiles to be deported in 597 BCE had been a priest called Ezekiel.*

According to the Bible, Ezekiel and his wife lived during the Babylonian captivity on the banks of the Chebar River, in Tel Aviv, with other exiles from Judah. There is no mention of him having any offspring.

Ezekiel describes his calling to be a prophet by going into great detail about his encounter with God and four "living creatures" with four wheels that stayed beside the creatures. For the next five years he incessantly prophesied and acted out the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, which was met with some opposition. However, Ezekiel and his contemporaries like Jeremiah, another prophet who was living in Jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies with the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.

Ezekiel had become an icon of the radical discontinuity that the cult of Yahweh involved: nothing could be taken for granted and normal responses were denied.

The pagan vision, on the other hand, had celebrated the continuity that was felt to exist between the gods and the natural world. Ezekiel found nothing consoling about the old religion, which he habitually called 'filth'.

During this time of exile, another prophet of whom we know nothing, preached tranquility. He comes from the school of Isaiah's disciples, and his work was later added to the oracles of Isaiah. He is usually called *Second Isaiah*.
First Isaiah made history a divine warning; after the catastrophe, in his Book of Consolation, Second Isaiah made history generate new hope for the future. Writing from Babylon, the author begins with a message of comfort and hope and faith in Yahweh. The people are to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem, which has paid "double for all her sins". As creator and Lord of history, God will redeem Israel, his chosen servant. Through the Servant of the Lord all the nations will be blessed: "I have put my Spirit upon him, he will bring forth justice to the nations." If Yahweh had rescued Israel once in the past, he could do it again.

Second Isaiah wastes no time denouncing the gods of the _goyim_. He calmly assumed that Yahweh - not Marduk or Baal - had performed the great mythical deeds that brought the world into being. For the first time, the Israelites became seriously interested in Yahweh's role in creation, perhaps because of renewed contact with the cosmological myths of Babylon.

Yahweh had finally absorbed his rivals in the religious imagination of Israel; in exile, the lure of paganismlost its attraction and the religion of Judaism was born. At a time when the cult of Yahweh might reasonably have been expected to perish, he became the means that enabled people to find hope in impossible circumstances.

_When Cyrus, King of Persia, conquered the Babylonian empire in 539 BCE, it seemed as though the prophets had been vindicated. Cyrus didn't impose the Persian gods on his new subjects but worshipped at the Temple of Marduk when he entered Babylon in triumph. In 538 BCE, Cyrus issued an edict permitting the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild their own temple. Most of them, however, elected to stay behind: henceforth only a minority would live in the Promised Land._

The Bible tells us that 42,360 Jews left Babylon and Tel Aviv and began the trek home, where they imposed their new Judaism on their bewildered brethren who had remained behind.

[.underline]#We can see twhat this entailed in the writings of the Priestly tradition (P), which were written afetr the exile and inserted into the Pentateuch. This gave its own interpretation of the events described by J and E and added two new books, Numbers and Leviticus. As we might expect, P had an exalted and sophisticated view of Yahweh. He did not believe, for example, that anybody could actually _see_ God in the way that J had suggested. Sharing many of the perspectives of Ezekiel, he believed that there was a distiction between human perception of God and reality itself. In P's story of Moses of Sinai, Moses begs for a vision of Yahweh, who replies: 'You can not see my face, for no man can see me and live.' Instead, Moses must shield himself from the divine impact in a crevice of the rock, where he will catch a glimpse of Yahweh as he departs, in a kind of hindsight. P had introduced an idea that would become extremely important in the history of God. Mortals can only see an afterglow of the divine presence, which he calls 'the glory (_kavod_) of Yahweh', a manifestation of his presence, which is not to be confused with the God himself. When the Moses came down from the mountain, his own face had reflected this 'glory' and shone with such an unbearable light that the Israelites could not look upon him. In P's narrative it was the 'glory' of Yahweh filling the tent where he met with Moses. Similarly it would be only 'glory of Yahweh' that would dwell in the Temple.#

P's most famous contribution to the Pentatauch was, of course, the account of creation in the first chapter of Genesis, which drew upon the _Enuma Elish_. P began with the waters of the primordial abyss (_tēhom_, a corruption of Tiamat), out of which Yahweh fashions the heavens and earth. There was no battle of the Gods, however, or struggle with Yam, Lotan or Rahab. Yahweh alone was responsible for calling all the things in being.

*In 332 BCE Alxeander of Macedonia defeated Darius III of Persia and the Greeks began to colonize Asia and Africa.*
They founded city-states in Tyre, Sidon, Gaza, Philadelphia(Amman), Tripolis and even at Schechem. The Jews of Palestine and diaspora were surrounded by an Hellenic culture which some found disturbing but others were excited by Greek theatre, philosophy, sport, and poetry. They learned Greek, exercised at the gymnasium and took Greek names. Some fought as mercenaries in the Greek armies. They even translated their own scriptures into Greek, producing the version known as Septuagint. Thus some Greeks came to know the God of Israel and decided to worsjip Yahweh (or Iao, as they called him) alongside Zeus and Dionysius. Some were attracted to synagogues or meeting houses, which the diaspora Jews had eveolved in place of the Temple worship. Since there was no ritual or sacrifice, it must have seemed mor elike school of philosophy and many flocked to the synagogue if a well known Jewish preacher came to town, as they would queue up to hear their own philosophers. During the fourth century BCE, there were isolated incidents of Jews and Greeks merging Yahweh with one of the Greek gods.

Most Jews held aloof, however, and tension developed between Jews and Greeks in the Hellenistic cities of the Middle East. Jews had started to produce their own literature which argued that Wisdom was not Greek cleverness but the fear of Yahweh.

Wisdom literature is a genre of literature common in the ancient Near East. It consists of statements by sages and the wise that offer teachings about meaning of life, divinity and virtue. Although this genre uses techniques of traditional oral storytelling, it was disseminated in written form. 

Near East: Mesopotamia (modern Iraq, southeast Turkey, southwest Iran, northeastern Syria and Kuwait), ancient Egypt, ancient Iran (Elam, Media, Parthia and Persia), Anatolia/Asia Minor and the Armenian Highlands (Turkey's Eastern Anatolia Region, Armenia, northwestern Iran, southern Georgia, and western Azerbaijan), the Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan), Cyprus and the Arabian Peninsula.

*The author of the book of Proverbs, who was writing in the third century BCE*, went a little further and suggested that Wisdom was the masterplan that God had devised when he had created the world and, as such, wa dthe first of his creaturs. The author personifies Wisdom so the she seems a separate person. She is similar to 'glory' of God described by the Priestly authors, representing the plan of God that human beings could glimpse in creation and in human affairs.

Liek the 'glory' of Yahweh, the figure of Wisdom was a symbol of God's activity in the world.

Wisdom literature acquired a *_polemic_* edge in Alexandria in about *50 BCE**. In the _The Wisdom of Solomon_, as Jew of Alexandria, where there was an important Jewish community, warned Jews to resist the seductive Hellenic culture around them and to remain true to their own traditions: it is the fear of Yahweh, not Greek philosphy, which constitues true wosdom. Writing in Greek, he also personified Wisdom (Sophia) and argued that it could not be separated from the Jewish God.

[quote, 'Wisdom 7:25-26']
____
(_Sophia_) is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty … She is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness.
____

[NOTE]
====
polemic (/pəˈlɛmɪk/) a strong verbal or written attack on someone or something. Mid 17th century: via medieval Latin from Greek _polemikos_, from _polemos_ ‘war’.

This passage would also be extremely important to Christians when they came to discuss the status of Jesus. THe Jewish author, however, simply saw Sophia as an aspect of the unknowable God who has adapted himself to human understanding. She is God-as-he-has-revealed-himself-to-man, the human perception of God, which was mysteriously distinct from the full reality of God which would always elude our understading. 

There is a crucial, and perhaps, an irreconcilable difference between the God of Aristotle, which is scarcely aware of the world it has created, and the God of the Bible who is passionately involved in human affairs. The Greek God could be discovered by human reason, whereas the God of the Bible only made himself known by means of revelation.

When the Romans had established their empire in North Africa and the Middle East in the *first century BCE* they had themselves succumbed to the Greek culture, merging their ancestral deities with the Greek pantheon and adopting Greek philosophy with enthusiasm. They had not, however, inherited the Greek hostility to the Jews. Jews were given full religious liberty: their religion was known to be great antiquity and this was respected. *By the first century CE*, Judaism was in a very strong position in the Roman empire. One tenth of the whole empire was Jewish: in Philo's Alexandria, forty per cent of the population were Jews. The Romans were drawn to the high moral characters of Judaism.

In Palestine, a group of political zealots fiercely opposed Roman rule. *In 66 CE* they orchestrated a rebellion against Rome and, incredibly, managed to hold rhe Roman armies at bay for four years. The authorities feared that the rebellionb would spread to the Jews of the diaspora and were forced to crush it mercilessly. *In 70 CE* the armies of the new Emperor Vespasian finally conquered Jerusalem, burned the Temple to the ground and made the city a Roman city called Aeila Capitolana. Yet again the Jews were forced into exile.

*The loss of the Temple, which had been the inspiration of the new Judaism*, was a great grief but with hindsight it seems that the Jews of Palestine, who were often more conservative than the Hellenised Jews of the diaspora, had already prepared for the catastrophe. Various sects had sprung up in the Holy Land, which has in different ways dissociated from the Jerusalem Temple. They had withdrawn to live in separate communities, such as monastic style community beside the Dead Sea. They believed that hey were building a new TEmple, not made with hands. Their would be a Temple of Spirit; instead of the old animal sacrifices, they purified themselves and sought forgiveness of sins by baptismal ceremonies and communal meals. God would live in a loving brotherhood, not in a stone temple.

It is said that after the conquest of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yohannan had been smuggled out of burning city in coffin. He had been opposed to the Jewish revolt and thought that the Jews would be better off without a state. The Romans allowed him to found a self-governing Pharisaic community at Jabneh, to the west of Jerusalem. Similar communities were founded in Palestine and Babylonia, which maintained close links. These communities produced scholars known as the _tannaim_, including rabbinic heroes like Rabbi Yohannan himself, Rabbi Akiva the mystic, and Rabbi Ishmael: they campiled the Mishnah, the codification of an oral law which brought the Mosaic law up to date. Next a new set of scholars, known as _amoraim_. began commentary on the Mishnah and produced the treatises known as the Talmud. *In fact two Talmuds had been compiled: The Jerusalem Talmud, which was completed by the fourth century, and the Babylonian Talmud, which is considered the more authoritative and which was not completed until the end of fifth century.* 

Yahweh had always been transcendent deity, who directed human beings from above and without. The Rabbis made him intimately present within the mankind and the smallest of the details of life. After the loss of the Temple and the harrowing experience of yet another exile, the Jews needed a God in their midst. The Rabbis did not construct any formal doctrines about God. Instead, they experienced him as an almost tangible presence.

The Rabbis frequently suggest that, on Mount Sinai, each one of the Israelites who had been standing at the foot of the mountain had experienced God in a different way. God had, as it were, adapted himself to each person _according to the comprehension of each_. As one Rabbi put it, _God does not come to man oppresively but commensurately with a man's power of receiving him._ God was essentially subjective experience. Each individual would or prophets had experienced God differently, the Rabbis insisted, because his personality has influenced his conception of the divine. 

Any official doctrine would limit the essential mystery of God. The Rabbis pointed out that he was utterly incomprehensible. Not even Moses had been able to penetrate the mystery of God. Jews are even forbidden to pronounce his name, powerful reminder that any attempt to express him was bound to be inadequate: the divine name was written YHWH and not pronounced in any reading of the scripture. The whole point of the idea of God was to encourage a sense of mystery and wonder of life, not to find neat solutions. The Rabbis even warned the Israelites against praising God too frequently in their prayers, because their word were bound to be defective.

One of their favorite synonyms for God was the *Shekinah*, which derived from the Hebrew _shakan_, to dwell with or to pitch one's tent. Now that the Temple wasd gone, the image of the God which had accompanied the Israelites on their wanderings in the wilderness suggested the accesibility of God. Like the divine 'glory' or the Holy Spirit, the Shekinah was not conceived as a separate divine being but as the presence of God on earth. The Rabbis argued that the destruction of Temple had freed the Shekinah from Jerusalem and enabled it to inhabit the rest of the world. 

The connection between Israel and its God was so strong that, when he had redeemed them in the past, the Israelites used to tell God: 'Thou hast redeemed _thyself_.' In their own distinctively Jewish way, the Rabbis were developing that sense of God as identified with the self, which the Hindus had called Atman.

Like early Christians, the Israelities were encouraged by their Rabbis to see themselves as a united community with 'one body and one soul'. The community was the new Temple, enshrining the immanent God: thus when they enter the synagogues and recite the _Shema_ in perfect unison 'with devotion, with one voice, one mind and one tone', God (Shekinah) is present among them. But he hates any lack of harmony in the community and returns to heaven, where angels chant the divine praises 'with one voice and one melody'.

Jews were not to think of God as a Big Brother, watching their every move from above; instead they were to cultivate a sense of God within each human beingso that our dealings with others became sacred encounters. This was not a lofty setiment but a basic legal principle. 

The God of Israel had sometimes seemed to encourage a most unholy and inhumane cruelty. But over the centuries Yahweh had become an idea that could help people to cultivate a compassion and respect for their fellow human beings, which had always been a hallmark of the religions of the Axial Age. Teh ideals of the Rabbis were close to the second of the God-religions, which has its roots in exactly the same tradition.
