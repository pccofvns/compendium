= The Selfish Gene

== Why Are People

We humans, like all other animals , are machines created by our genes. The predominant quality to be expected in successful gene is ruthless selfishness, which gives rise in selfishness of individual behavior. There are [.underline]#*_special_*# circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a [.underline]#*_limited_*# form of altruism at the level of individual animals.

Genetically inherited traits are not fixed or unmodifiable. Our genes may instruct us to be selfish, but we are not necessarily compelled to obey them all our lives. It all depends on 'nature vs. nurture'.

*Altruistic* - An entity such as baboon, is said to be altruistic if it behaves in such a way as to increase another such entity's welfare at the expense of his own. Selfish behavior has exactly the opposite effect. _'Welfare'_ is defined as _'chances of survival'_, even if the effect on actual life and death prospects is so small as to _seem_ negligible. These definitions of altruism and selfishness are _behavioural_, not subjective. This definition is concerned only with whether the _effect_ of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary. 

It is a very complicated business to demondtrate the effects of behavior on long-term survival prospects. An apparently altruistic act is one that looks, superficially, as if it must tend to make the altruist more likely(however slightly) to die, and recipient more likely to survive. It often turns out on closer inspection that acts of apparent altruism are really selfishness in disguise, that doesn't mean the underlying motives are secretly selfish, but the real effects of the act on survival propspects are the reverse of what we originally thought. 

=== Example of apparently 'altruistic' and selfish behaviours

.Blackheaded gulls
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Chroicocephalus_ridibundus_%28summer%29.jpg[title="Blackheaded Gull"] Blackheaded gulls nest in large colonies, the nests being only a few feet apart. When the chicks first hatch out they are small and defenceless and easy to swallow. It is quite common for a gull to wait until a neighbour's back is turned, perhaps while it is away fishing, and then pounce on one of the neighbour's chicks and swallow it whole. It thereby obtains a good nutritious meal, without having to go to the trouble of catching a fish, and without having to leave its own nest unprotected.

.Sexual cannibalism in Mantises
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Praying_Mantis_Sexual_Cannibalism_European-37.jpg[title="Sexual cannibalism in Mantis religiosa"] Mantises are large carnivorous insects. They normally eat smaller insects such as flies, but they will attack almost anything that moves. When they mate, the male cautiously creeps up on the female, mounts her, and copulates. If the female gets the chance, she will eat him, beginning by biting his head off, either as the male is approaching, or immediately after he mounts, or after they separate. It might seem most sensible for her to wait until copulation is over before she starts to eat him. But the loss of the head does not seem to throw the rest of the male's body off its sexual stride. Indeed, since the insect head is the seat of some inhibitory nerve centres, it is possible that the female improves the male's sexual performance by eating his head. If so, this is an added benefit. The primary one is that she obtains a good meal.

.Emperor penguins in the Antarctic
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Penguin_in_Antarctica_jumping_out_of_the_water.jpg[title="Emperor penguin jumping out of the water in Antarctica"] Emperor penguins in the Antarctic have been seen standing on the brink of the water, hesitating before diving in, because of the danger of being eaten by seals. If only one of them would dive in, the rest would know whether there was a seal there or not. Naturally nobody wants to be the guinea pig, so they wait, and sometimes even try to push each other in.

.Worker Bees
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Todd_Huffman_-_Lattice_(by).jpg[title="Worker bees (with queen)"] An example of 'apparently' altruistic behaviour. The stinging behaviour of worker bees is a very effective defence against honey robbers. But the bees who do the stinging are kamikaze fighters. In the act of stinging, vital internal organs are usually torn out of the body, and the bee dies soon afterwards. Her suicide mission may have saved the colony's vital food stocks, but she herself is not around to reap the benefits. By our definition this is an altruistic behavioural act.

.Alarm call by  birds
[example]
Many small birds, when they see a flying predator such as a hawk, give a characteristic 'alarm call', upon which the whole flock takes appropriate evasive action. There is indirect evidence that the bird who gives the alarm call puts itself in special danger, because it attracts the predator's attention particularly to itself. This is only a slight additional risk, but it nevertheless seems, at least at first sight, to qualify as an altruistic act by our definition.

The commonest and most conspicuous act of animal altruism are done by parents, especially mothers, towards their children.

.Distraction display by some ground-nesting birds
[example]
Many ground-nesting birds perform a so-called 'distraction display' when a predator such as a fox approaches. The parent bird limps away from the nest, holding out one wing as though it were broken. The predator, sensing easy prey, is lured away from the nest containing the chicks. Finally the parent bird gives up its pretence and leaps into the air just in time to escape the fox's jaws. It has probably saved the life of its nestlings, but at some risk to itself.

A group, such as species, or a population within the species, whose individual members are prepared to sacrifice (e.g. bees) themselves for the welfare of the group, may be less likely to go extinct than a rival group whose individual members place their own interest first. Therefore, the world becomes mainly populated by the groups consisting of self-sacrificing individuals. This is the theory of [.underline]#'group selection'#, long assumed to be true by biologists not familiar with the details of evolutionary theory, brought out in open by V. C. Wynne-Edwards, and popularized by Robert Ardrey in _The Social Contract_. As an answer to this theory, someone may argue that even in the group of altruists, there will almost certainly be a dissenting minority who refuse to make sacrifice. If there is just one selfish rebel, prepared to exploit the altruism of the rst, then he, by definition, is more likely to surive and have children. In several generations, upon inheriting such selfish traits, such group will be overrun by selfish individuals.

Often altruism within a group goes with selfishness between groups. This is a basis of trade unionism. At another level the nation is major beneficiary of our altruistic self sacrifice. Moreover they are encouraged to kill other individuals about whom nothing is known except that they belong to different nation. (Curiously, peace-time appeals for individuals to make some small sacrifice in the rate at which they increase their standard of living seem to be less effective than war-time appeals for individuals to lay down their lives.)

== The Replicators

Darwin's 'survival of the fittest' is really a special case of a more general law of _survival of the stable_. The universe is populated by stable things.

If a group of atoms in the presence of energy falls into a stable pattern, it will tend to stay that way. The point that is releveant here is that, before coming of life on earth, some rudimentry evolution of molecules could have occurred by ordinary processes of physics and chemistry. The earliest form of natural selection was simply a selection of stable forms and a rejection of unstable ones.

Laboratory conditions of earth before coming to life have yielded organic substances called *purines* and *pyrimidines*. These are building block of the genetic molecule, DNA itself.

Process analogous to this experiment must have given rise to the 'primeval soup' which biologists and chemists believe constituted the seas some three to four thousand million years ago. The orgaqnix substances became locally concentrated, perhaps in drying scum round the shores, or in tiny suspended droplets. Under the further influence of energy such as untraviolet light from the sun, they combined into larger molecules. They lasted long and drifted unfettered because bacteria were not born back then. 

At some point, a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the [.underline]#*_replicator_*#.

Replicators had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself. As soon as replicator was born, it must have spread copies rapidly throughout the sea until smaller building blocks molecule became a scarce resource, and other larger molecules were formed more and more rapidly. 

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Self-replication_of_sphynx_hexidiamonds.svg[title="Four 'sphinx' hexiamonds can be put together to form another sphinx."]

Such replication process is not perfect and mistakes happen and mistakes happen. Erratic copying in bioligical replicators can in real sense give rise to 'improvement', and it was essential for the progressive evolutionof life that some errors were made. Mistakes in copying of DNA, is what makes evolution possible.

As miscopying were made and propagated, the primeval soup became filled by a population not of identical replica, but of several varieties of replicating molecules, all 'descended' from same ancestor. Some varieties would have been numerous than the others for the reason that some molecule are stabler than others. Stable molecule live long and had greater chance to self-replicate. The quantity was consequence of 'longevity'. This would have created an 'evolutionary trend' towards 'greater longevity'. 

The speed of replication 'fecundity' of a molecule is also a factor that could have been given rise to the population of certain molecule. Long living molecule with less fecundity would have less population. Therefore there would have been and evolutionary trend of higher 'fecundity'. 

A third characteristic which would have been positively selected is accuracy of replication, i.e. to exactly produce same molecule. With each generation of molecule, if mistakes are made; molecule with less mistake per generation would become more numerous. However, this idea seems to be against natural selection. High copying-fidelity would have negative impact on evolution. Evolution may seem as a 'good thing', especially since we are the product of it, nothing actually 'wants' to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it from happening. 

Sampling the primeval soup, at two different times; we would find high propertion of varieties with high longevity/fecundity/copying-fidelity in later samples. This is essentially what biologists mean by evolution when they are speaking of living creatures, and the mechanism is same - natural selection.

The next important link in the argument, one that Darvin himself laid stress on (although he was talking about animals and plants, not molecules), is _competition_. The primeval soup was not capable of supporting an infinite number of replicator molecules. For one thing, the earth's size is finite, but other limiting factors must also have been important. In our picture of the replicator acting as a template or mould, bathing in primeval soup rich of building block molecules necessary to make copies. This makes, the building block molecule a scarce resource. Different varieties of replicator strains would compete for it unknowingly. This created struggle of existence. The struggle would favor any miscopying that resulted in higher level of stability, or a new way of reducing the stability of rivals. Such molecules automatically preserved and multiplied. Ways of increasing stability and of decreasing rivals' stability became more elaborate and mor eefficient. Some of them may even have 'discovered' how to break up molecules of rival varieties checmically, and to use building blocks so released for making their own copies. These proto-carnivores simultaneously obtained food and removed competing rivals. Other replicators perhaps discovered how to protect themselves, either chemically, or by building a physical wall of protein around themselves. [.underline]#This may have been how the first living cell appeared.# Replicators began not merely to exist, but to construct for themselves containers, vehicles for their continued existence. The replicators that survived were the ones that built _survival machines_ for themselves to live in. The first survival machine probably consisted of nothing more than a protective coat. Survial machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the process was cumulative and progressive. 

== Immortal Coils

We are all survival machines for the same kind of replicator - molecules called DNA. A DNA molecule is a long chain of building blocks, small molecules called nucleotides. It consists of a pair of necleotide chain twisted together in an elegant spiral; the 'double helix'; the 'immortal coil'. Four kinds of such nucelotides are there, A, T, C, and G. In different species, the order in which these are strung together differs. 

image::https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/acgt.jpg[title="DNA molecule"] 

[NOTE]
ACGT is an acronym for the four types of bases found in a DNA molecule: adenine (A), cytosine (C ), guanine (G), and thymine (T). A DNA molecule consists of two strands wound around each other, with each strand held together by bonds between the bases. Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. The sequence of bases in a portion of a DNA molecule, called a gene, carries the instructions needed to assemble a protein.

Each cell of our bodies contain a complete copy of that body's DNA, with some exceptions which we can ignore. This DNA can be regarded as a set of instructions for how to make a body, written in the A, T, C, G alphabet of the nucelotides. It is as though, in every room of a gigantic building, there was a book case containing the architect's plan for the entire building. The 'book-case' in a cell is called the nucleus. The architect's plan run to 46 'volumes' in man - the number is different in other species. The 'volumes' are called chromosomes. They are visible under a microscope as long threads, and the genes are strung out along them in order. The 'pages' inside each volume represents gene. 

First thing which DNA does is that it replicates and is very good at it. It indirectly supervises manufacture of protein. Proteins not only constitute much of physical fabric of the body; they also exert sensitive control over all the chemical processes inside the cell, selectively turning them on and off at precise times and in precises places. 

The evolutionary importance of the fact that genes control embryonic development is this: it means that genes are at least partly responsible for their own survival in the future, because their survival depends on the efficiency of the bodies, the survival machines in which they live and which they helped to build.

Modern replicators are highly gregarious. A survival machine is vehicle containing not one gene but many thousands. The manufacture of body is a cooperative venture of such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution of one gene from that of another. A given gene will have many different effects on quite different parts of the body. A given part of body will be influenced by many genes, and the effect of any gene depends on interaction with many others. Some genes act as master genes controlling the operation of cluster of other genes. In terms of analogy, any given page of the plans makes reference to many different parts of the building; and each page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages. 

We could use the word gene-complex instead of using the word gene because of this intricate inter-dependence of genes.  we don't do this because of sexual reproduction has the effect of missing and shuffling genes. This means that any one individual body is just a temporary for a short lived combination of genes. The _combination_ of genes that is one individual may be short-lived, but the genes themselves are potentially very long-lived. 

The 46 chromosomes are consisting of 23 pairs, e.g. Volume 1a and Volume 1b, 2a and 2b, ... Volumes 1a, 2a, 3a, ...came, say, from the father. Volumes 1b, 2b, 3b, ... came from the mother. The paired chromosomes do not spend all their lives physically in contact with each other, or even near each other. These paired chromosomes are paired in the sense that volumes coming from father can be regarded, page for page, as a direct alternative to one particular volume coming originally from the mother. For instance, Page 6 of Volumne 13a and Page 6 of Volume 13b might both be 'about' eye colour; perhaps one says 'blue' while the other says 'brown'.

In case of contradictory recommendation, e.g. brown eye vs. blue eye; the prevailing recommendation is of [.underline]#*_dominant_*# gene's while the one that is ignored is [.underline]#*_recessive_*# gene. This doesn't stop recessive gene to be passed on to future generations. When such two genes, like the brown eye/blue eye; are rivals for the same slot on a chromosome, they are called [.underline]#*_alleles_*# of each other.

.allele
[TIP]
====
An allele is a variant form of a gene. Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome. Humans are called diploid organisms because they have two alleles at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent. Each pair of alleles represents the genotype of a specific gene. Genotypes are described as homozygous if there are two identical alleles at a particular locus and as heterozygous if the two alleles differ. Alleles contribute to the organism's phenotype, which is the outward appearance of the organism.

Some alleles are dominant or recessive. When an organism is heterozygous at a specific locus and carries one dominant and one recessive allele, the organism will express the dominant phenotype. 
====

Normal cell division, where each cell receiving a complete copy of all 46 chromosomes is called [.underline]#*_mitosis_*#. Another cell division which occurs only in production of the sex cells; the sperms or eggs is called [.underline]#*_meosis_*#. Sperms and eggs are unique among our cells, because they contain only 23 cells, whuch fuse in sexual fertilization to make a new individual! Meosis occurs in ovaries and testicles where full doeble set of 46 chromosomes divide to form sex cells with single set of 23. 

During the manufacture of sperm, single pages, or rather multipage chunks are detached and swapped with the [.underline]#corresponding# chunks from tje alternative volume. So, one particular sperm cell might make up its Volume 1 by taking first 65 pages from Volume 1a, and pages 66 to the end from Volume 1b. This sperm cell's other 22 volumes would be made up in a similar way. Therefore every sperm cell made by an individual is unique, even though all his sperms assembled their 23 chromosomes from the bits of the same set of 46 chromosomes. Eggs are made in a similar way, and they too are all unique. The process of swapping bits of chromosome is called [.underline]#*_crossing over_*#. 

The metaphor of the page for the gene starts to break down here. In a loose-leaf binder a whole page may be inserted, removed or exchanged, bit not a fraction of page. But the gene complex is just a long string of necleotide letters, not divided into dicrete pages in an obvious way at all. To be sure, there are special symbols for END OF PROTEIN CHAIN MESSAGE and START OF PROTEIN CHAIN MESSAGE written in same four letter alphabet as the protein message themselves. In between this START and END, are the encoded instructions for making one protein. Such unit is called [.underline]#*_cistron_*#. Crossing over does not respect boundaries defined by the cistrons. Splits occur within the cistrons as well as between them. Cistrons are not of fixed length and are defined by START and END tags. Architect's plan were written out, not on discrete pages, but on 46 rolls of ticker tape. Crossing over is represented by taking matching paternal and maternal tapes, and cutting and exchanging matching portions, regardless of what is written on them. Only way to tell where one cistron ends and the next one begins is by reading the symbols in the tape.

A gene is defined a s any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection. A gene is replicator of high copying-fidelity. 

A genetic unit is any random sequence of adjacent code letters on the ticker tape. Shorter the genetic unit, the longer - in generations - it is likely to survive. It is less likely to be split by any obe crossing-ver. A single cistron is liekly to be much less than 1% of the length of chromosome. Such small genetic unit (a cistron) has only a 1% chance of being split in meotic division. it can expect to live many generations before being broken up by crossing over. 

If we take whole chromosome to be our genetic unit, its life story lasts for only one generation. Suppose, it is chromosome number 8a, inherited from your father. it was uniquely created inside one of your father's testicles, shortly before you were conceived. It was created by meotic shuffling, forged by coming together pieces of chromosome from your paternal grandmother and your paternal grandfather. It was placed inside one particular sperm out of many millions sperms.

This genetic unit, your chromosome number 8a, is now set about replicating itself along with the rest of your genetic material. Now it exists in duplicate form all over your body. When it is now your turn to have children, this chromosome will be destroyed when you manufacture eggs(or sperms). Bits of it will be interchanged with bits of your maternal chromosome 8b. In any one sex cell, a new chromosome 8 will be created, definitely different, and definitely unique. [.underline]#The life-span of chromosome is one generation.#

Consider a smaller genetic unit, say 1/100 of the length of chromosome 8a. This unit too came from your father but it was probably received from one of the grandparents (99% chance). Tracing back this way we can reach to the stage where this was [.underline]#*created*# first time inside a testicle or an ovary of one of your ancestors. [.underline]#This genetic unit is considered to be created at this moment here in the sense that the particular _arrangement_ of sub-units by which it is defined didn't exist before that particular moment#.

The chance coming together of previously existing sub-units, through crossing-over is the usual way for a new genetic unit to formed. Another rare way is [.underline]#*_point-mutation_*#, which is an error corresponding to a single misprinted letter in a book.

Another rare kind of mistake or mutation is [.underline]#*_inversion_*#. A piece of chromosome detaches itself at both ends, and then flips iteself, and then re-attaches in the inverted position. Sometimes these positions do not just invert, become reacttached in a completely different part of the chromosome, or even join up with different chromosome altogether.

Simple inversion corresponds to the renumbering of pages and the re-attaching to a different part of chromosome or a to a different chromosome corresponds to transfer of wads of pages from one volume to another.

The importance of this kind of mistake is that, though usually disastrous, it can occasionally lead to the close _linkage_ of pieces of genetic material which happens to work well together. Perhaps two cistrons which have benefical effectonly when they are both present--they complement or reinforce each other in some way--will be brought close to each other by means of inversion. The natural selection may tend to favour the new 'genetic unit' so formed, and it will spread through the future population.

One of the neatest example of this concerns the phenomenon known as [.underline]#*_mimicry_*#. Some butterflies taste nasty. They are usually bright and distictively coloured, and bird learn to avoid them by their 'warning' marks. Now other species of butterfly that do not taste nasty cash in. They _mimic_ the nasty ones. They are born looking like them in colour and shape (but not taste). They frequently fool human naturalists, and they also fool birds. A bird who has tasted a genuinely nasty butterfly tends to avoid all butterflies that look the same. This includes the mimics, and so genes for mimicry are favoured by natural selection. This is how mimicry evolves.

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Papilio_polytes-Thekkady-2016-12-03-001.jpg[title="Papilio polytes"]
image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Common_Rose_%28Pachliopta_aristolochiae%29_W_IMG_9133.jpg[title="A well-known mimic, Papilio polytes (top) resembles the unpalatable Pachliopta aristolochiae (bottom)."]

Some individuals of species mimic one nasty species; other individuals mimic another. Any individual who was intermediate or who tried to mimic both would soon be eaten; but such intermediates are not born. Just as an individual is either definitely male or definitely female, so an individual butterfly mimics either one nasty species or the other. One butterfly mimics species A while his brother mimics species B.

A single gene in the  sense of _cistron_  can not determine whether and individual will mimic species A or species B. But by unconcious and automatic 'editing' achieved by inversion and other accidental rearrangements of genetic material, a large cluster of formerly separate genes has come together in a tight linkage group on a chromosome. [.underline]#The whole cluster behaves like a single gene--indeed, by our definition it now is a single gene--and it has an 'allele' which is really another cluster.# One cluster contains cistrons concerned with mimicking species A; the other those concerned with mimicking species B. [.underline]#Each cluster is so rarely split up by crossing over that an intermediate butterfly is never seen in nature#, but they very occasionally turn up if large numbers of butterflies are bred in the laboratory.

Gene is used to mean a genetic unit that is small enough to last for a large number of generations and to be distributed around in the form of many copies. A gene is not indivisible but it is seldom divided. It is either definitely present or definitely absent in an individual. If gene continually blended with each other, natural selection as we now understand it would be impossible. Another aspect of the particulateness of gene is that it does not grow senile. it leaps from body to body down to the generations, manipulating body after body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of martal bodies before they sink into senility and death.

The genes are immortals, or rather, they are defined as genetic entities that come close to deserving the title.

In sexually reproducing species, the individual is too large and too temporary a genetic unit to qualify as a significant unit of natural selection. A group of individuals is an even larger unit. Populations may last a long while, but they are constantly blending with other populations and so losing their identity. They are also subject to evolutionary change from within. A populatuion is not a discrete enough entity to be a unit of natural selection, not stable and not unitary enough to be 'selected' in preference to another population. 

Each individual is unique. You cannot get evolution by selecting between entities when there is only one copy of each entity!

Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themesleves survive the shufflingThe cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on.

The life of any one physical DNA molecule is quite short--perhaps a matter of months, certainly not more than one lifetime. But a DNA molecule could theoretically live on in the form of _copies_ of itself for a hundred million years. This emphasizes the near immortality of a gene, in the form of copies, as its defining property. 

Gene is the largest genetic entity which at least potentially has longevity, fecundity, and copying fidelity. [.underline]#The gene is a long-lived replicator, existing in the form of many duplicate copies.# The length of such genetic unit depends on natural selection 'pressure', that is how much more likely a 'bad' genetic unit is to die than its 'good' allele. The largest practical unit of natural selection - the gene - will usually be found to be somewhere on the scale between cistron and chromosome. The gene is defined as a piece of chromosome which is sufficiently short for it to last, for _long enough_ for it to function as significant unit of natural selection.

It is its *potential immortality* that makes a gene a good candidate as a basic unit of natural selection. But now the time has come to stress the word 'potential'. A gene _can_ live for million years, but many new genes do not even make it past their first generation. The few new ones that succeed do so partly because they are lucky, but mainly because they have what it takes, and that means that are good at making survival machines. They have an effect on the embryonic development of each successive body in which they find themselves, such that that is a little bit more likely to live and reproduce that it would have been under the influence of rival gene or allele. For example, a 'good' gene might ensure its survival by tending to endow the successive bodies in which it finds itself with long legs, which help those bodies to escape from predators.

Genes are competing directly with their alleles for their survival, since their alleles in the gene pool are rivals for their slot on the chromosomes of future generations. Any gene that nehaves in such way as to increase its own survival chances in the gene pool at the expense if its alleles will, by definition, tautologously, tend to survive. The gene is basic unit of selfishness. 

Expressions like 'gene for long legs' or 'gene for altruistic behavior' are convenient figure of speech, but it is important to understand what they mean. There is no gene which single-handedly builds a leg, long or short. Building a leg is a multigene cooperative enterprise. Influences from external environments too are indidpensable: after all, legs are actually made of food!  But there may well be a single gene whuch, _other things equal_, tend to make legs longer that they would have been under the influence of gene's allele. 

As far as gene is concerned, its alleles are its deadly rivals, but other genes are just part of its environment, comparable to temprature, food, predators, or companions. Sometimes a gene has one effect in the presence of a particular another set of companion genes. The whole set of genes in a body constitute a kind of genetic climate or background, modifying and influencing the effect of any particular gene. 

As we saw in the case of the butterflies, natural selection may unconsciously 'edit' a gene complex by means of
inversions and other gross movements of the bits of chromosome, thereby bringing genes that cooperate well together into closely linked groups. But there is also a sense in which genes which are in no way linked to each other physically can be selected for their mutual compatibility. For example, a number of attributes are desirable in an efficient carnivore's body, among them sharp cutting teeth, the right kind of intestine for digesting meat, and many other things. An efficient herbivore, on the other hand, needs flat grinding teeth, and a much longer intestine with a different kind of digestive chemistry. In a herbivore gene pool, any new gene that conferred on its possessors sharp meat eating teeth would not be very successful. This is not because they are bad genes, they are only bnad genes in a gene pool that is dominated by genes for herbivorous qualities. 

'Selfishness' is one among most general attributes of a 'good' gene. Another general quality of successful genes is a tendency to postpone death of their survival machines at least until after reproduction.

A gene that makes its possessors dies us called a lethal gene. A semilethal gene has some debilitating effect, such that it makes death from other causes probable. Any gene exerts its maximum effect on bodies at some particular stage of life, and lethals and semilethals are not exceptions. Most genes influence during foetal life, others during childhood, other during young adulthood, others in middle age, and yet others in old age. 

image::https://www.butterflyidentification.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Life-Cycle-of-a-Butterfly.jpg[title="A caterpillar and the butterfly it turns into have exactly same set of genes"]

Obviously lethal genes that will tend to be removed from the gene pool. But equally obviously a late-acting lethal will be more stable in the gene pool than an early-acting leathal. A gene that is lethal in an older body may still be successful in the gene pool, provided its lethal effect does not show itself until the body has had time to do at least some reproducing. For instance, a gene that made old bodies develop cancer could be passed on to numerous offsprings becaus ethe individuals would reproduce before they got cancer. On the other hand, a gene that made adult bodies develop cancer would not be passed on to very many offspring, and a gene that made children develop fatal cancer would not be passed to any offspring at all. According to this theory [.underline]#senile decay is simply a by-product of the accumulation in the gene pool of late-acting lethal and semi-lethal genes, which have been allowed to slip through the net of natural selection simply because they are late-acting.#

[quote, Peter Medawar's Mutation accumulation theory]
____
In the case where harmful mutations are only expressed later in life, when reproduction has ceased and future survival is increasingly unlikely, then these mutations are likely to be unknowingly passed on to future generations. In this situation the force of natural selection will be weak, and so insufficient to consistently eliminate these mutations. Medawar posited that over time these mutations would accumulate due to genetic drift and lead to the evolution of what is now referred to as ageing.
____

This theory has some rather interesting speculations. For instance, it follows from it that if we wanted to increase the human life span, there are two general way in which we could do it. Firstly, we could ban reproduction before a certain age, say forty. After some centuries of this the minimum age limit would be raised to fifty, and so on. It is conceivable that human longevity could be pushed up to several centuries by this means.

Secondly we could try to 'fool' genes into thinking that the body they are sitting in is younger than it really is. In practice thus would mean identifying chnages in the internal chemical environment of body that take place during ageing. Any of these could be 'cues' to 'turn on' late-acting lethal genes.

With reservations, the gene pool play the same role for the modern replicators as the primeval soup did for the original ones. Sex and chromosoal crossing-over have the effect of preserving the liquidity of the modern equivalent of the soup. Because of sex and crossing-over the gene pool is kept well stirred, and genes partially shuffled.

The set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.  Such as stripes on tiger or zebra, height, eye color, and blood type. The genetic contribution to the phenotype is called the genotype. From _pheno_ - showing from greek _phainein_ - to show.

== The Gene Machine

Survival machines began as passive receptacles for the genes, providing little more than walls to protect them from the chemical warfare of their rivals and the ravages of accidental molecular bombardment. In the earlt days they 'fed' on organic molecules freely available in the soup. This easy life came to an end when when the organic food in the soup, which had been slowly built up under the energentic influence of centuries of sunlight, was all used up. A major branch of survival machines, now called plants, started to use sunlight directly themselves to build up complex molecules from simple ones, re-enacting at much higher speed the synthetic processes of the original soup. Another branch, now known as animals, 'discovered' how to exploit the chemical labours of the plants, either by eating them or by eating other animals. Sub-branches and sub-sub-branches evolved, each one excelling in a particular specialized way of making a living: in the sea, on the ground, in the air, under the ground, up trees, inside other living bodies.

Both animals and plants evolved into many cell bodies, complete copies of all the genes being distributed to every cell. Some people use the metaphor of a colony, describing a body as a colony of cells. It may be thought of as a colony of _genes_, and of the cell as a convenient working unit for the chemical industries of the genes.

This chapter is about _behavior_ -- the trick of rapid movement which has been largely exploited by the animal branch of survival machines. 

The gadhet that animals evolved to achieve rapid movement was the muscle. Muscles are engines which, like the steam engine and the internal combustion engine, use energy stored in chemical fuel to generate mechanical movement. It is more intersting to know - how these muscle contractions are _timed_.

In many artificical machines timing is achieved by that brilliant invention of cam.

This translates simple rotary motion into a complex rhythmic pattern of operations by means of an eccentric or specially shaped wheel. Other machines such as steam organ and the pianola use paper rolls or cards with holes punched in a pattern. Recently there has been a rend towards replacing such simple mechanical timers with electronic ones. The basic component of a modern electronic machine like a computer is the semiconductor, of which a familiar form is the transistor.

Survival machines seems to have bypassed the cam and the punched card altogether. The apparatus they use for timing their movements has more in common with an electronic computer, although it is strictly different in fundamental operation. The basic unit of biological computers, the nerve cell or neurone is much more sophisticated data processing unit than a transitor, however it is slower and more miniature. Instead of just three connections with other components, a single neurone may have tens of thousands.  

Plants have no need of neurones, beacuse they get their living without moving around, but it is found in great majority of animal groups. It may have been 'discovered' early in animal evolution, and inherited by all groups, or it may have been 'rediscovered' several times independently.

Neurones are basically just cells, with nucleus and chromosomes like other cells. But their cell walls are drawn out in long, thin, wire like projections. Often a neurone has one particularly long 'wire' called the axon. Although the width of the axon is microscopic, its length may be many feet. The axons are usually bundled together in thick multi-stranded cables called nerves. Other neurones have short axons, and are confined to dense concentrations of nervous tissue called ganglia, or, when they are very large, brains. 

The main way in which brains actually contribute to the success of the survival machines is by controlling and coordinating the contraction of muscles using cable called motor nerves which lead to muscles. But this leads to effiecient preservation of genes only if timing of muscle contraction bears some relation to the timing of events is the outside world. It is important to contract the muscles only when the jaws contain something worth biting, and to contract the leg muscles in running patterns only when ther eis something worth running towards or away from. For this reason, natural selection favouured animals, that became equipped with sense organs - by means of cables called sensory nerves. 

There may be a time when sense organs communicated more or less directly with muscles; indeed, sea anemones are not far from this state today, since for their way of life, it is efficient.

To achieve more complex and indirect relationship between the timing of events in the outside world and the timing of muscular contractions, brain is needed as intermediary. By the inventions of memory the timing of muscle contractions could be influenced not only by the events in the immediate past, but by the events in the distant past as well.

One of the most striking properties of survival machines is its apparent purposiveness, e.g. searching for food, looking for mate, or for a lost child. It may include 'desire' for some object, a 'mental picture' of the desired object, an 'aim' or 'end in view'. In our modern machines, this purposiveness has evolved the property we call 'consciousness'. 

The unconscious purposive behavior are among the commonplaces of engineering science. The classic example is Watt steam governor. The fundamental principle involved is called _negative feedback_, of which there are various forms.

The genes control the behavior of their survival machines, not directly with their finger tips of puppet machines, but indirectly liek a computer programmer teaching a computer to play chess by writing some instructions. Like programmer tells the computer basic moves of the game, not separately for every possible starting position, but in terms of more economically expressed rules. When the computer is actually playing, it is on its own, and can expect no help from its master. All the programmer can do is to set the computer up _beforehand_ in the best way possible, with a proper balance between list of specific knowledge and hints about strategies and techniques. 

The genes too control the behavior in passive manner. Genes can't grab the reins and take charge because of time-lag problems. Genes work by controlling protein synthesis, which is slow, yet powerful way of manipulating the world. The whole point about behavior, on the other hand, is that it is fast. It works on a time-scale not of months but of seconds and fraction of seconds. Like the chess programmer, the genes have to 'instruct' their survival machines not in specifics, but in general strategies and tricks of the living trade. 

[quote, J. Z. Young]

The genes have to perform task analogous to prediction.
____

Polar bear genes can safely predict that the future of their unborn survival machine is going to be cold one. They build a thick coat of hair, because that is what they have always done to previous bodies, and that is why they exist in the gene pool to this day. They also predict that the ground is going to be snowy, and their predictions takes the form of making the coat of their hair white and therefore camouflaged. If the climnate of Arctic changed so rapidly that the baby bear found itself to be born in tropical desert, the predictions of genes would be wrong, and they would pay the penalty. The young bear would die and they inside it.

Every decision that a survival machine takes is a gamble, and it is business of genes to program brains in advance so that on average they take decisions that pay off. The currency used in the casino of evolution is survival, strictly gene survival, but for many purposes individual survival is a reasonable approcimation. For example, a gamble a thirsty animal have to take going down the water-hole to drink, that contains the risk of eaten by predators. Should it wait, and go later; should it take quick little gulps of water while running past the water-hole; or should it take a one good long drink to reduce the number of visits to the water-hole. Are there animal gamblers who play for high stakes, and others with a more conservative game?

One way to for genes to solve the problem of making predictions in rather unpredcitable environments is to build a capacity for learning. Learning can be achieved by trial and error, and if memory allows seek help from past outcomes of such event. 

One of the most interesting methods of predicting the future is simulation. No amount of simulation can predict exactly what will happen in reality, but a good simulation is enormously preferable to blind trial and error.

If simulation is such a good idea, we might expect that survival machines would have discovered it first. After all, they invented many of the other techniques of human engineering long before we came on the scene: the focusing lens and the parabolic reflector, frequency analysis of sound waves, servo-control, sonar, buffer storage of incoming information, and countless others. What about simulation? Well, when you yourself have a difficult decision to make involving unknown quantities in the future, you do go in for a form of simulation. You imagine what would happen if you did each of the alternatives open to you. You set up a model in your head, not of everything in the world, but of the restricted set of entities which you think may be relevant. You may see them vividly in your mind's eye, or you may see and manipulate stylized abstractions of them. In either case it is unlikely that somewhere laid out in your brain is an actual spatial model of the events you are imagining. But, just as in the computer, the details of how your brain represents its model of the world are less important than the fact that it is able to use it to predict possible events. Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error. The trouble with overt trial is that it takes time and energy. The trouble with overt error is that it is often fatal. Simulation is both safer and faster.

The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. There is no reason to suppose that electronic computers are conscious when they simulate, although we have to admit that in the future they may become so. Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself. Obviously the limbs and body of a survival machine must constitute an important part of its simulated world; presumably for the same kind of reason, the simulation itself could be regarded as part of the world to be simulated. Another word for this might indeed be 'self-awareness'.

Whatever the philosophical problems raised by consciousness, for the purpose of this story it can be thought of as the culmination of an evolutionary trend towards the emancipation of survival machines as executive decision-takers from their ultimate masters, the genes. Not only are brains in charge of the day-to-day running of survival-machine affairs, they have also acquired the ability to predict the future and act accordingly. They even have the power to rebel against the dictates of the genes, for instance in refusing to have as many children as they are able to. But in this respect man is a very special case, as we shall see.

The animal behaviour, altruistic or selfish, is under the control of genes in only an indirect, but still very powerful, sense. By dictating the way survival machines and their nervous systems are built, genes exert ultimate power over behaviour. But the moment-to-moment decisions about what to do next are taken by the nervous system. Genes are the primary policy-makers; brains are the executives. But as brains became more highly developed, they took over more and more of the actual policy decisions, using tricks like learning and simulation in doing so. The logical conclusion to this trend, not yet reached in any species, would be for the genes to give the survival machine a single overall policy instruction: do whatever you think best to keep us alive.

In order for a behaviour pattern-altruistic or selfish-to evolve, it is necessary that a gene 'for' that behaviour should survive in the gene pool more successfully than a rival gene or allele for some different behaviour. One study of a behaviour pattern which does not happen to be obviously altruistic, but which is complex enough to be interesting. It serves as a model for how altruistic behaviour might be inherited.

Honey bees suffer from an infectious disease called foul brood. This attacks the grubs in their cells. Of the domestic breeds used by beekeepers, some are more at risk from foul brood than others, and it turns out that the difference between strains is, at least in some cases, a behavioural one. There are so-called hygienic strains which quickly stamp out epidemics by locating infected grubs, pulling them from their cells and throwing them out of the hive. The susceptible strains are susceptible because they do not practise this hygienic infanticide. The behaviour actually involved in hygiene is quite complicated. The workers have to locate the cell of each diseased grub, remove the wax cap from the cell, pull out the larva, drag it through the door of the hive, and throw it on the rubbish tip.
Doing genetic experiments with bees is quite a complicated business for various reasons. Worker bees themselves do not ordinarily reproduce, and so you have to cross a queen of one strain with a drone (= male) of the other, and then look at the behaviour of the daughter workers. This is what W. C. Rothenbuhler did. He found that all first-generation hybrid daughter hives were non-hygienic: the behaviour of their hygienic parent seemed to have been lost, although as things turned out the hygienic genes were still there but were recessive, like human genes for blue eyes. When Rothenbuhler 'back-crossed' first-generation hybrids with a pure hygienic strain (again of course using queens and drones), he obtained a most beautiful result. The daughter hives fell into three groups. One group showed perfect hygienic behaviour, a second showed no hygienic behaviour at all, and the third went half way. This last group uncapped the wax cells of diseased grubs, but they did not follow through and throw out the larvae. Rothenbuhler surmised that there might be two separate genes, one gene for uncapping, and one gene for throwing-out. Normal hygienic strains possess both genes, susceptible strains possess the alleles-rivals- of both genes instead. The hybrids who only went halfway presumably possessed the uncapping gene (in double dose) but not the throwing-out gene. Rothenbuhler guessed that his experimental group of apparently totally non-hygienic bees might conceal a subgroup possessing the throwing-out gene, but unable to show it because they lacked the uncapping gene. He confirmed this most elegantly by removing caps himself. Sure enough, half of the apparently non-hygienic bees thereupon showed perfectly normal throwing-out behaviour.

This story illustrates a number of important points which came up in the previous chapter. 

1. It shows that it can be perfectly proper to speak of a 'gene for behaviour so-and-so' even if we haven't the faintest idea of the chemical chain of embryonic causes leading from gene to behaviour. The chain of causes could even turn out to involve learning. For example, it could be that the uncapping gene exerts its effect by giving bees a taste for infected wax. This means they will find the eating of the wax caps covering disease-victims rewarding, and will therefore tend to repeat it. Even if this is how the gene works, it is still truly a gene for uncapping provided that, other things being equal, bees possessing the gene end up by uncapping, and bees not possessing the gene do not uncap.

2. Secondly it illustrates the fact that genes 'cooperate' in their effects on
the behaviour of the communal survival machine. The throwing-out gene is useless unless it is accompanied by the uncapping gene and vice versa. Yet the genetic experiments show equally clearly that the two genes are
in principle quite separable in their journey through the generations. As far as their useful work is concerned you can think of them as a single cooperating unit, but as replicating genes they are two free and independent agents.

*The behaviour of _communication_.* In a limited context, a survival machine may be said to have communicated with another one when it directly influences its behavior or the state of its nervous system. 

.Examples of communication
[example]
Examples of communication are numerous: song in birds, frogs, and crickets; tail-wagging and hackle-raising in dogs; 'grinning' in chimpanzees; human gestures and language. A great number of survival- machine actions promote their genes' welfare indirectly by influencing the behaviour of other survival machines. Animals go to great lengths to make this communication effective. The songs of birds enchant and mystify successive generations of men.
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Mole_cricket_burrow.png[] Mole-crickets amplify their song to stentorian loudness by singing down in a burrow which they carefully dig in the shape of a double exponential horn, or megaphone. Bees dance in the dark to give other bees accurate information about the direction and distance of food, a feat of communication rivalled only by human language itself.

The traditional story of ethologists is that communication signals evolve for the mutual benefit of both sender and recipient. For instance, baby chicks influence their mother's behaviour by giving high piercing cheeps when they are lost or cold. This usually has the immediate effect of summoning the mother, who leads the chick back to the main clutch. This behaviour could be said to have evolved for mutual benefit, in the sense that natural selection has favoured babies that cheep when they are lost, and also mothers that respond appropriately to the cheeping.

If we wish to (it is not really necessary), we can regard signals such as the cheep call as having a meaning, or as carrying information: in this case 'I am lost.' The alarm call given by small birds, which I mentioned in Chapter i, could be said to convey the information 'There is a hawk.' Animals who receive this information and act on it are benefited. Therefore the information can be said to be true. But do animals ever communicate false information; do they ever tell lies? In this we're  not interested in conscious intention to deceive. We're simply talking about having an effect functionally equivalent to deception.

.Examples of deception
[example]
Many edible insects, like the butterflies of the previous chapter, derive protection by mimicking the external appearance of other distasteful or stinging insects. We ourselves are often fooled into thinking that yellow and black striped hover-flies are wasps. Some bee-mimicking flies are even more perfect in their deception. Predators too tell lies. +
video::Z-BbpaNXbxg[youtube]
Angler fish wait patiently on the bottom of the sea, blending in with the background. The only conspicuous part is a wriggling worm-like piece of flesh on the end of a long 'fishing rod', projecting from the top of the head. When a small prey fish comes near, the angler will dance its worm-like bait in front of the little fish, and lure it down to the region of the angler's own concealed mouth. Suddenly it opens its jaws, and the little fish is sucked in and eaten. The angler is telling a lie, exploiting the little fish's tendency to approach wriggling worm-like objects. He is saying 'Here is a worm', and any little fish who 'believes' the lie is quickly eaten. +
Some survival machines exploit the sexual desires of others. Bee orchids induce bees to copulate with their flowers, because of their strong resemblance to female bees. What the orchid has to gain from this deception is pollination, for a bee who is fooled by two orchids will incidentally carry pollen from one to the other. Fireflies (which are really beetles) attract their mates by flashing lights at them. Each species has its own particular dot-dash flashing pattern, which prevents confusion between species, and consequent harmful hybridization. Just as sailors look out for the flash patterns of particular lighthouses, so fireflies seek the coded flash patterns of their own species. Females of the genus _Photuris_ have 'discovered' that they can lure males of the genus _Photinus_ if they imitate the flashing code of a _Photinus_ female. This they do, and when a _Photinus_ male is fooled by the lie into approaching, he is summarily eaten by the _Photuris_ female.


*All animal communication contains an element of deception right from the start because all animal interactions involves at least some conflict of interest. Most animal communication are best seen as neither informative not deceptive, but rather manipulative. A signal is a means by which one animal makes use of other animal's muscle power. Signals evolve from an interplay of what we call mind-reading and manipulation.*
