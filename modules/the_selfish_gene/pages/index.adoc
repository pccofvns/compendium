= The Selfish Gene

== Why Are People

We humans, like all other animals , are machines created by our genes. The predominant quality to be expected in successful gene is ruthless selfishness, which gives rise in selfishness of individual behavior. There are [.underline]#*_special_*# circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a [.underline]#*_limited_*# form of altruism at the level of individual animals.

Genetically inherited traits are not fixed or unmodifiable. Our genes may instruct us to be selfish, but we are not necessarily compelled to obey them all our lives. It all depends on 'nature vs. nurture'.

*Altruistic* - An entity such as baboon, is said to be altruistic if it behaves in such a way as to increase another such entity's welfare at the expense of his own. Selfish behavior has exactly the opposite effect. _'Welfare'_ is defined as _'chances of survival'_, even if the effect on actual life and death prospects is so small as to _seem_ negligible. These definitions of altruism and selfishness are _behavioural_, not subjective. This definition is concerned only with whether the _effect_ of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary. 

It is a very complicated business to demondtrate the effects of behavior on long-term survival prospects. An apparently altruistic act is one that looks, superficially, as if it must tend to make the altruist more likely(however slightly) to die, and recipient more likely to survive. It often turns out on closer inspection that acts of apparent altruism are really selfishness in disguise, that doesn't mean the underlying motives are secretly selfish, but the real effects of the act on survival propspects are the reverse of what we originally thought. 

=== Example of apparently 'altruistic' and selfish behaviours

.Blackheaded gulls
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Chroicocephalus_ridibundus_%28summer%29.jpg[title="Blackheaded Gull"] Blackheaded gulls nest in large colonies, the nests being only a few feet apart. When the chicks first hatch out they are small and defenceless and easy to swallow. It is quite common for a gull to wait until a neighbour's back is turned, perhaps while it is away fishing, and then pounce on one of the neighbour's chicks and swallow it whole. It thereby obtains a good nutritious meal, without having to go to the trouble of catching a fish, and without having to leave its own nest unprotected.

.Sexual cannibalism in Mantises
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Praying_Mantis_Sexual_Cannibalism_European-37.jpg[Sexual cannibalism in Mantis religiosa] Mantises are large carnivorous insects. They normally eat smaller insects such as flies, but they will attack almost anything that moves. When they mate, the male cautiously creeps up on the female, mounts her, and copulates. If the female gets the chance, she will eat him, beginning by biting his head off, either as the male is approaching, or immediately after he mounts, or after they separate. It might seem most sensible for her to wait until copulation is over before she starts to eat him. But the loss of the head does not seem to throw the rest of the male's body off its sexual stride. Indeed, since the insect head is the seat of some inhibitory nerve centres, it is possible that the female improves the male's sexual performance by eating his head. If so, this is an added benefit. The primary one is that she obtains a good meal.

.Emperor penguins in the Antarctic
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Penguin_in_Antarctica_jumping_out_of_the_water.jpg[Emperor penguin jumping out of the water in Antarctica] Emperor penguins in the Antarctic have been seen standing on the brink of the water, hesitating before diving in, because of the danger of being eaten by seals. If only one of them would dive in, the rest would know whether there was a seal there or not. Naturally nobody wants to be the guinea pig, so they wait, and sometimes even try to push each other in.

.Worker Bees
[example]
image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Todd_Huffman_-_Lattice_(by).jpg[Worker bees (with queen)] An example of 'apparently' altruistic behaviour. The stinging behaviour of worker bees is a very effective defence against honey robbers. But the bees who do the stinging are kamikaze fighters. In the act of stinging, vital internal organs are usually torn out of the body, and the bee dies soon afterwards. Her suicide mission may have saved the colony's vital food stocks, but she herself is not around to reap the benefits. By our definition this is an altruistic behavioural act.

.Alarm call by  birds
[example]
Many small birds, when they see a flying predator such as a hawk, give a characteristic 'alarm call', upon which the whole flock takes appropriate evasive action. There is indirect evidence that the bird who gives the alarm call puts itself in special danger, because it attracts the predator's attention particularly to itself. This is only a slight additional risk, but it nevertheless seems, at least at first sight, to qualify as an altruistic act by our definition.

The commonest and most conspicuous act of animal altruism are done by parents, especially mothers, towards their children.

.Distraction display by some ground-nesting birds
[example]
Many ground-nesting birds perform a so-called 'distraction display' when a predator such as a fox approaches. The parent bird limps away from the nest, holding out one wing as though it were broken. The predator, sensing easy prey, is lured away from the nest containing the chicks. Finally the parent bird gives up its pretence and leaps into the air just in time to escape the fox's jaws. It has probably saved the life of its nestlings, but at some risk to itself.

A group, such as species, or a population within the species, whose individual members are prepared to sacrifice (e.g. bees) themselves for the welfare of the group, may be less likely to go extinct than a rival group whose individual members place their own interest first. Therefore, the world becomes mainly populated by the groups consisting of self-sacrificing individuals. This is the theory of [.underline]#'group selection'#, long assumed to be true by biologists not familiar with the details of evolutionary theory, brought out in open by V. C. Wynne-Edwards, and popularized by Robert Ardrey in _The Social Contract_. As an answer to this theory, someone may argue that even in the group of altruists, there will almost certainly be a dissenting minority who refuse to make sacrifice. If there is just one selfish rebel, prepared to exploit the altruism of the rst, then he, by definition, is more likely to surive and have children. In several generations, upon inheriting such selfish traits, such group will be overrun by selfish individuals.

Often altruism within a group goes with selfishness between groups. This is a basis of trade unionism. At another level the nation is major beneficiary of our altruistic self sacrifice. Moreover they are encouraged to kill other individuals about whom nothing is known except that they belong to different nation. (Curiously, peace-time appeals for individuals to make some small sacrifice in the rate at which they increase their standard of living seem to be less effective than war-time appeals for individuals to lay down their lives.)

== The Replicators

Darwin's 'survival of the fittest' is really a special case of a more general law of _survival of the stable_. The universe is populated by stable things.

If a group of atoms in the presence of energy falls into a stable pattern, it will tend to stay that way. The point that is releveant here is that, before coming of life on earth, some rudimentry evolution of molecules could have occurred by ordinary processes of physics and chemistry. The earliest form of natural selection was simply a selection of stable forms and a rejection of unstable ones.

Laboratory conditions of earth before coming to life have yielded organic substances called *purines* and *pyrimidines*. These are building block of the genetic molecule, DNA itself.

Process analogous to this experiment must have given rise to the 'primeval soup' which biologists and chemists believe constituted the seas some three to four thousand million years ago. The orgaqnix substances became locally concentrated, perhaps in drying scum round the shores, or in tiny suspended droplets. Under the further influence of energy such as untraviolet light from the sun, they combined into larger molecules. They lasted long and drifted unfettered because bacteria were not born back then. 

At some point, a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the [.underline]#*_replicator_*#.

Replicators had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself. As soon as replicator was born, it must have spread copies rapidly throughout the sea until smaller building blocks molecule became a scarce resource, and other larger molecules were formed more and more rapidly. 

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Self-replication_of_sphynx_hexidiamonds.svg[Four 'sphinx' hexiamonds can be put together to form another sphinx.]

Such replication process is not perfect and mistakes happen and mistakes happen. Erratic copying in bioligical replicators can in real sense give rise to 'improvement', and it was essential for the progressive evolutionof life that some errors were made. Mistakes in copying of DNA, is what makes evolution possible.

As miscopying were made and propagated, the primeval soup became filled by a population not of identical replica, but of several varieties of replicating molecules, all 'descended' from same ancestor. Some varieties would have been numerous than the others for the reason that some molecule are stabler than others. Stable molecule live long and had greater chance to self-replicate. The quantity was consequence of 'longevity'. This would have created an 'evolutionary trend' towards 'greater longevity'. 

The speed of replication 'fecundity' of a molecule is also a factor that could have been given rise to the population of certain molecule. Long living molecule with less fecundity would have less population. Therefore there would have been and evolutionary trend of higher 'fecundity'. 

A third characteristic which would have been positively selected is accuracy of replication, i.e. to exactly produce same molecule. With each generation of molecule, if mistakes are made; molecule with less mistake per generation would become more numerous. However, this idea seems to be against natural selection. High copying-fidelity would have negative impact on evolution. Evolution may seem as a 'good thing', especially since we are the product of it, nothing actually 'wants' to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it from happening. 

Sampling the primeval soup, at two different times; we would find high propertion of varieties with high longevity/fecundity/copying-fidelity in later samples. This is essentially what biologists mean by evolution when they are speaking of living creatures, and the mechanism is same - natural selection.

The next important link in the argument, one that Darvin himself laid stress on (although he was talking about animals and plants, not molecules), is _competition_. The primeval soup was not capable of supporting an infinite number of replicator molecules. For one thing, the earth's size is finite, but other limiting factors must also have been important. In our picture of the replicator acting as a template or mould, bathing in primeval soup rich of building block molecules necessary to make copies. This makes, the building block molecule a scarce resource. Different varieties of replicator strains would compete for it unknowingly. This created struggle of existence. The struggle would favor any miscopying that resulted in higher level of stability, or a new way of reducing the stability of rivals. Such molecules automatically preserved and multiplied. Ways of increasing stability and of decreasing rivals' stability became more elaborate and mor eefficient. Some of them may even have 'discovered' how to break up molecules of rival varieties checmically, and to use building blocks so released for making their own copies. These proto-carnivores simultaneously obtained food and removed competing rivals. Other replicators perhaps discovered how to protect themselves, either chemically, or by building a physical wall of protein around themselves. [.underline]#This may have been how the first living cell appeared.# Replicators began not merely to exist, but to construct for themselves containers, vehicles for their continued existence. The replicators that survived were the ones that built _survival machines_ for themselves to live in. The first survival machine probably consisted of nothing more than a protective coat. Survial machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the process was cumulative and progressive. 

== Immortal Coils

We are all survival machines for the same kind of replicator - molecules called DNA. A DNA molecule is a long chain of building blocks, small molecules called nucleotides. It consists of a pair of necleotide chain twisted together in an elegant spiral; the 'double helix'; the 'immortal coil'. Four kinds of such nucelotides are there, A, T, C, and G. In different species, the order in which these are strung together differs. 

image::https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/acgt.jpg[title="DNA molecule"] 

[NOTE]
ACGT is an acronym for the four types of bases found in a DNA molecule: adenine (A), cytosine (C ), guanine (G), and thymine (T). A DNA molecule consists of two strands wound around each other, with each strand held together by bonds between the bases. Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. The sequence of bases in a portion of a DNA molecule, called a gene, carries the instructions needed to assemble a protein.

Each cell of our bodies contain a complete copy of that body's DNA, with some exceptions which we can ignore. This DNA can be regarded as a set of instructions for how to make a body, written in the A, T, C, G alphabet of the nucelotides. It is as though, in every room of a gigantic building, there was a book case containing the architect's plan for the entire building. The 'book-case' in a cell is called the nucleus. The architect's plan run to 46 'volumes' in man - the number is different in other species. The 'volumes' are called chromosomes. They are visible under a microscope as long threads, and the genes are strung out along them in order. The 'pages' inside each volume represents gene. 

First thing which DNA does is that it replicates and is very good at it. It indirectly supervises manufacture of protein. Proteins not only constitute much of physical fabric of the body; they also exert sensitive control over all the chemical processes inside the cell, selectively turning them on and off at precise times and in precises places. 

The evolutionary importance of the fact that genes control embryonic development is this: it means that genes are at least partly responsible for their own survival in the future, because their survival depends on the efficiency of the bodies, the survival machines in which they live and which they helped to build.

Modern replicators are highly gregarious. A survival machine is vehicle containing not one gene but many thousands. The manufacture of body is a cooperative venture of such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution of one gene from that of another. A given gene will have many different effects on quite different parts of the body. A given part of body will be influenced by many genes, and the effect of any gene depends on interaction with many others. Some genes act as master genes controlling the operation of cluster of other genes. In terms of analogy, any given page of the plans makes reference to many different parts of the building; and each page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages. 

We could use the word gene-complex instead of using the word gene because of this intricate inter-dependence of genes.  we don't do this because of sexual reproduction has the effect of missing and shuffling genes. This means that any one individual body is just a temporary for a short lived combination of genes. The _combination_ of genes that is one individual may be short-lived, but the genes themselves are potentially very long-lived. 

The 46 chromosomes are consisting of 23 pairs, e.g. Volume 1a and Volume 1b, 2a and 2b, ... Volumes 1a, 2a, 3a, ...came, say, from the father. Volumes 1b, 2b, 3b, ... came from the mother. The paired chromosomes do not spend all their lives physically in contact with each other, or even near each other. These paired chromosomes are paired in the sense that volumes coming from father can be regarded, page for page, as a direct alternative to one particular volume coming originally from the mother. For instance, Page 6 of Volumne 13a and Page 6 of Volume 13b might both be 'about' eye colour; perhaps one says 'blue' while the other says 'brown'.

In case of contradictory recommendation, e.g. brown eye vs. blue eye; the prevailing recommendation is of [.underline]#*_dominant_*# gene's while the one that is ignored is [.underline]#*_recessive_*# gene. This doesn't stop recessive gene to be passed on to future generations. When such two genes, like the brown eye/blue eye; are rivals for the same slot on a chromosome, they are called [.underline]#*_alleles_*# of each other.

.allele
[TIP]
====
An allele is a variant form of a gene. Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome. Humans are called diploid organisms because they have two alleles at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent. Each pair of alleles represents the genotype of a specific gene. Genotypes are described as homozygous if there are two identical alleles at a particular locus and as heterozygous if the two alleles differ. Alleles contribute to the organism's phenotype, which is the outward appearance of the organism.

Some alleles are dominant or recessive. When an organism is heterozygous at a specific locus and carries one dominant and one recessive allele, the organism will express the dominant phenotype. 
====

Normal cell division, where each cell receiving a complete copy of all 46 chromosomes is called [.underline]#*_mitosis_*#. Another cell division which occurs only in production of the sex cells; the sperms or eggs is called [.underline]#*_meosis_*#. Sperms and eggs are unique among our cells, because they contain only 23 cells, whuch fuse in sexual fertilization to make a new individual! Meosis occurs in ovaries and testicles where full doeble set of 46 chromosomes divide to form sex cells with single set of 23. 

During the manufacture of sperm, single pages, or rather multipage chunks are detached and swapped with the [.underline]#corresponding# chunks from tje alternative volume. So, one particular sperm cell might make up its Volume 1 by taking first 65 pages from Volume 1a, and pages 66 to the end from Volume 1b. This sperm cell's other 22 volumes would be made up in a similar way. Therefore every sperm cell made by an individual is unique, even though all his sperms assembled their 23 chromosomes from the bits of the same set of 46 chromosomes. Eggs are made in a similar way, and they too are all unique. The process of swapping bits of chromosome is called [.underline]#*_crossing over_*#. 

The metaphor of the page for the gene starts to break down here. In a loose-leaf binder a whole page may be inserted, removed or exchanged, bit not a fraction of page. But the gene complex is just a long string of necleotide letters, not divided into dicrete pages in an obvious way at all. To be sure, there are special symbols for END OF PROTEIN CHAIN MESSAGE and START OF PROTEIN CHAIN MESSAGE written in same four letter alphabet as the protein message themselves. In between this START and END, are the encoded instructions for making one protein. Such unit is called [.underline]#*_cistron_*#. Crossing over does not respect boundaries defined by the cistrons. Splits occur within the cistrons as well as between them. Cistrons are not of fixed length and are defined by START and END tags. Architect's plan were written out, not on discrete pages, but on 46 rolls of ticker tape. Crossing over is represented by taking matching paternal and maternal tapes, and cutting and exchanging matching portions, regardless of what is written on them. Only way to tell where one cistron ends and the next one begins is by reading the symbols in the tape.

A gene is defined a s any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection. A gene is replicator of high copying-fidelity. 

A genetic unit is any random sequence of adjacent code letters on the ticker tape. Shorter the genetic unit, the longer - in generations - it is likely to survive. It is less likely to be split by any obe crossing-ver. A single cistron is liekly to be much less than 1% of the length of chromosome. Such small genetic unit (a cistron) has only a 1% chance of being split in meotic division. it can expect to live many generations before being broken up by crossing over. 

If we take whole chromosome to be our genetic unit, its life story lasts for only one generation. Suppose, it is chromosome number 8a, inherited from your father. it was uniquely created inside one of your father's testicles, shortly before you were conceived. It was created by meotic shuffling, forged by coming together pieces of chromosome from your paternal grandmother and your paternal grandfather. It was placed inside one particular sperm out of many millions sperms.

This genetic unit, your chromosome number 8a, is now set about replicating itself along with the rest of your genetic material. Now it exists in duplicate form all over your body. When it is now your turn to have children, this chromosome will be destroyed when you manufacture eggs(or sperms). Bits of it will be interchanged with bits of your maternal chromosome 8b. In any one sex cell, a new chromosome 8 will be created, definitely different, and definitely unique. [.underline]#The life-span of chromosome is one generation.#

Consider a smaller genetic unit, say 1/100 of the length of chromosome 8a. This unit too  came from your father
